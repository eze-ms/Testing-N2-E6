# Array Index Out Of Bounds Test

## 📄 Description

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Create a method that triggers an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
    - Validate that the exception is thrown when an invalid index is accessed.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Implements structured exception testing with JUnit 5.
    - Provides feedback through console output for better traceability.
